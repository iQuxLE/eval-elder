    # Ancestors of C are {A, PA}, and ancestors of A are {PA}.
    # Find Closest: A is closer to PA as it has fewer ancestors. So, A is returned as the highest parent of E.

    # In this method, the initial removal of PA from the set of ancestors is to avoid directly returning PA as
    # the highest parent (as it's presumably a generic or root term).
    # The subsequent checks ensure that we only consider ancestors that eventually lead to PA.
